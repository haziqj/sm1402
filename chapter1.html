# Representation of Data

---
layout: true

# Types of data 

Numeric data can be one of two types: *discrete* or *continuous*.

---

### Discrete data

Discrete data can take **only exact (whole) values**, for example:

--

- the number of lecture rooms in UBD,
- the number of students in a class,
- the number of durians on each tree in a plantations.

--

Example of raw discrete data: _An orange tree produces roughly the same number of fruits per tree. A survey of 30 orange trees yielded the following number of fruits per tree._


```
21 22 24 20 22 23 21 24 22 23 25 22 22 23 22
```

```
22 23 21 22 23 22 20 21 21 22 20 23 22 23 23
```

---

### Continuous data

Continuous data _cannot_ take exact (whole) values, but can be given only within a specified range, or measured to a specified degree of accuracy.

--

- the heights of students in UBD,
- the length of classrooms in UBD,
- the travel time in minutes from home to UBD.

--

Example of raw continuous data: _A survey of the heights of 20 children in a sports club yielded the following measurements (rounded to the nearest centimetre)_


```
133 136 120 138 133 131 127 141 127 143
```

```
130 131 125 144 128 134 135 137 133 129
```

---
layout: true 

# Grouping data

Raw data can be grouped for a more concise presentation.

---

### Discrete data (oranges from trees)
  
Count the number of times each value occurs and summarise these in a table known as a **frequency distribution**


```
21 22 24 20 22 23 21 24 22 23 25 22 22 23 22
```

```
22 23 21 22 23 22 20 21 21 22 20 23 22 23 23
```



|Number of oranges |20 |21 |22 |23 |24 |25 |Total |
|:-----------------|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-----|
|Frequency         |3  |5  |11 |8  |2  |1  |30    |

---

### Continuous data (children's heights)

To form a **frequency distribution** of the heights of the 20 children, group the information into **classes or intervals**


```
133 136 120 138 133 131 127 141 127 143
```

```
130 131 125 144 128 134 135 137 133 129
```



|Height (cm) |119.5-124.5 |124.5-129.5 |129.5-134.5 |134.5-139.5 |139.5-144.5 |Total |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----|
|Freq.       |1           |5           |7           |4           |3           |20    |

The values 119.5, 124.5, 129.4, ... are called the **class boundaries**. The **upper class boundary** of one interval is the lower class boundary of the next interval.

---

### Terminology

- The **mode** (for discrete data) is the is the value which occurs most often.    This can be read off directly from the frequency distribution.

  For the orange data, the mode is _22 oranges_.

- The **width of an interval** (for grouped data) is the difference between boundaries.

  For the children's height frequency distribution, the interval width used was _5cm_.

# Ways of grouping data

---

&lt;u&gt;Example 1&lt;/u&gt;

_The length of 30 metal rods were measured to the nearest millimetres._

| Length (mm) |   27-31   |   32-36   |   37-46   |   47-51   |
|-------------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Freq.       |     4     |     11    |     12    |     3     |

- The interval 27-31 means 26.5mm `\(\leq\)` length `\(&lt;\)` 31.5mm, and so on.
- The class boundaries are 26.5, 31.5, 36.5, 46.5, and 51.5.
- The class widths&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; are 5, 5, 10, and 5.

.footnote[
----
[1] Class widths do not necessarily have to be the same for all classes.
]

---

&lt;u&gt;Example 2&lt;/u&gt;

_100 students took a test, and their marks are tabulated._

| Mark  | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-59 | 60-69 | 70-79 | 80-99 |
|-------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|-------|-------|
| Freq. |   10  |   14  |   26  |   20  | 18    | 12    |

The frequency distribution can be interpreted in two ways:

- As **discrete** data.
  - The interval 30-39 represents 30 `\(\leq\)` mark `\(&lt;\)` 40.
  - The class boundaries are 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100.
  - The class widths are 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 20.
- As **continuous** data assuming marks are to the nearest integer.
  - The interval 30-39 represents 29.5 `\(\leq\)` mark `\(&lt;\)` 39.5.
  - The class boundaries are 29.5, 39.5, 49.5, 59.5, 69.5, 79.5, 99.5.
  - The class widths are 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 20.

---

&lt;u&gt;Example 3&lt;/u&gt;

_Ages (in completed years) of applicants for a teaching post._

| Age (years) | 21-24 | 25-28 | 29-32 | 33-40 | 41-52 |
|-------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|-------|
| Freq.       |   4   |   2   |   2   |   1   | 1     |

- Since ages are given in _completed years_ (not to the nearest year), then '21-24' means 21 `\(\leq\)` age `\(&lt;\)` 25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
- We can also write the categories as '21-', '25-', etc.
- The class bounderies are 21, 25, 29, 33, 41, 53.
- The class widths are 4, 4, 4, 8, 12.

# Histograms

---

Consider the following table for the distribution of ages of 118 passengers on a shuttle flight from Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.

| Age (years) | 0-19 | 20-39 | 40-49 | 50-69 | 70-100 |
|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|--------|
| Frequency   |   4  |   44  |   36  |   28  | 6      |

A **histogram** provides a visual representation of _grouped data_.

---

| Age (years) | 0-19 | 20-39 | 40-49 | 50-69 | 70-100 |
|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|--------|
| Frequency   |   4  |   44  |   36  |   28  | 6      |

&lt;img src="chapter1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1100" /&gt;

---

- In a histogram, the area of each bar is proportional to the frequency that it represents, and thus
$$
\text{total area} \propto \text{total frequency}
$$

- The vertical axis is not labelled frequency, but _frequency density_&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where
$$
\text{freq. density} = \frac{\text{frequency}}{\text{interval width}}
$$

.footnote[
----
[1] You may also find histograms with the vertical axis labelled 'density' (c.f. density plots), or even 'frequency' (this type of histogram visualises where values are concentrated).
]

---

- Using the formula given, we can calculate the complete table for the histogram as follows:

| Age (years) | Interval width | Frequency | Freq. density |
|-------------|:--------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| 0-19        |       20       |     4     |  4 ÷ 20 = 0.2 |
| 20-39       |       20       |     44    | 44 ÷ 20 = 2.2 |
| 40-49       |       10       |     36    | 36 ÷ 10 = 3.6 |
| 50-69       |       20       |     28    | 28 ÷ 20 = 1.4 |
| 70-99       |       30       |     6     |  6 ÷ 30 = 0.2 |

---

- Histograms may have bars of different widths, so the height of the bar must be adjusted accordingly.

- The **modal class** is the interval with the &lt;u&gt;greatest frequency density&lt;/u&gt;, i.e. the interval represented by _the highest bar_ in the histogram. For the current example, the modal class is the interval '40-49'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

.footnote[
----
[1] Notice that this interval does not have the greatest frequency, but it does have the greatest frequency density.

# Frequency polygons

---

An alternative way of displaying grouped data is using **frequency polygons**.

---

| Age (years) | 0-19 | 20-39 | 40-49 | 50-69 | 70-100 |
|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|--------|
| Frequency   |   4  |   44  |   36  |   28  | 6      |

&lt;img src="chapter1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="1100" /&gt;

---

To construct a frequency polygon, 
- Calculate the mid-interval value, where
  $$
  \text{mid-interval value} = \frac{1}{2}(\text{LCB} + \text{UCB})
  $$
- Calculate the frequency densities.
- Join points together with a straight line.

---

- Calculate the complete table for the frequency polygon:

| Age (years) | Mid-interval value  | Interval width | Frequency | Freq. density |
|-------------|---------------------|:--------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| 0-19        | (0 + 20) ÷ 2 = 10   |       20       |     4     |  4 ÷ 20 = 0.2 |
| 20-39       | (20 + 40) ÷ 2 = 30  |       20       |     44    | 44 ÷ 20 = 2.2 |
| 40-49       | (40 + 50) ÷ 2 = 45  |       10       |     36    | 36 ÷ 10 = 3.6 |
| 50-69       | (50 + 70) ÷ 2 = 60  |       20       |     28    | 28 ÷ 20 = 1.4 |
| 70-99       | (70 + 100) ÷ 2 = 85 |       30       |     6     |  6 ÷ 30 = 0.2 |

# Pie charts

---

Yet another diagram to display grouped data is a pie chart.

- A circle (pie) is divided into several **sectors** (slices of the pie), with each sector corresponding to a class interval.

- The central angle `\(\theta\)` of the sectors are _proportional_ to the frequencies of the intervals they represents, according to the formula

$$
\theta = \frac{\text{class freq.}}{\text{total freq.}} \times 360°
$$

- The area of a sector `\(A\)` of a circle with radius `\(r\)` is given by the formula

$$
A = \frac{\text{class freq.}}{\text{total freq.}} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

# Data Summaries

# The mean

- A 'typical' or 'average' value is useful when interpreting data. One such alue is the **mean**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

- The formula for the mean is
  $$
  \bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \frac{x_1 + \cdots + x_n}{n}
  $$
   

- Consider 5 numbers
  ```
  0.9, 1.4, 2.8, 3.1, 5.6
  ```
  The mean is `\((0.9 + 1.4 + 2.8 + 3.1 + 5.6) / 5 = 13.8 / 5 = 2.76\)`.


.footnote[
[1] 'Average' does not always refer to the 'mean'. There are other measures of _central tendencies_, such as the mode, median and others.
]

---

# Variability

- Each of these sets of numbers has a mean of 7, but the _spread_ of each set is different.
  ```html
  (a): 7, 7, 7, 7, 7
  (b): 4, 6, 6.5, 7.2, 11.3
  (c): -193, -46, 28, 69, 177
  ```

&lt;img src="chapter1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="1100" /&gt;

---
layout:true

# Variability

We can measure the **variability** or spread of a distribution by calculating the _range_ and the _standard deviation_.

---

### The range


- The range is based entirely on the extreme values of the distribution.
  $$
  \text{range} = \text{highest value} - \text{lowest value}
  $$
  ```html
  (a): range(7, 7, 7, 7, 7)        = 7 - 7        = 0
  (b): range(4, 6, 6.5, 7.2, 11.3) = 11.3 - 4     = 7.3
  (c): -193, -46, 28, 69, 177      = 177 - (-193) = 370
  ```

---

### The standard deviation and the variance

- The standard deviation `\(s\)` gives a measure of the deviations of the readings from the mean `\(\bar x\)`.

- Steps to calculate `\(s\)` (for `\(i=1,\dots,n\)`)
  1. For each reading `\(x_i\)`, calculate `\(x_i-\bar x\)`, its deviation from the mean
  2. Square this deviation to give `\((x_i-\bar x)^2\)`
  3. Sum all of these squared deviations to give `\(\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2\)`
  4. Divide this sum by `\(n\)` to give the **variance**
  5. Finally, take the positive square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation `\(s\)`

---

### The standard deviation and the variance

- The formula for the variance is given by
  $$
  s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n}
  $$
  
--
  
- The formula for the standard deviation is given by
  $$
  s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n}}

# Notes on the s.d.

- The units of the standard deviation are the _same_ as the units of the data.

- Standard deviations are useful when comparing sets of data; the higher the standard deviation, the greater the variability in the data.

- Alternative formula for the s.d.
  $$
  s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{n} - \bar x ^2}
  $$

# Cumulative frequencies

- The cumulative frequency is the **total frequency** _up to a particular item_. 

- A cumulative frequency distribution can be obtained from a frequency distribution and can be illustrated 
  - When the data are _discrete_ and _ungrouped_ (**step diagram**);
  
  - When the data are _continuous_ or in the form of _grouped discrete distribution_ (**cumulative frequency polygon/curve**).

- It only makes sense when you read from the discrete whole values on the horizontal axis. It would be silly to consider 3.6 attempts, for example.

- In the step diagram, the _mode_ is given by the value of the variable that gives the 'steepest' step.

Joining all the points with a straight line gives a **cumulative frequency polygon**. This assumes that the readings are _evenly_ distributed throughout the intervals.

# Median and quartiles

---

For data arranged in order of size,

- The **lower quartile** `\(Q_1\)` is the value 25% of the way through the distribution.

- The **median** `\(Q_2\)` is the value 50% of the way through the distribution.

- The **upper quartile** `\(Q_3\)` is the value 75% of the way through the distribution.

Therefore, the median, lower quartile and upper quartile together split the distribtion into four equal parts.

- The **inter-quartile range**, defined as the difference between the quartiles, tells you the range of the middle 50% of the distribution.
$$
\text{IR} = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

# Quartiles for ungrouped data

---

- For ungrouped data consisting of `\(n\)` observations arranged in ascending order of size, the median is the 
$$
Q_2 = \frac{1}{2}(n + 1)\text{th observation}
$$
  - If there is an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value.
  - If there is an even number of observations, there are two middle values, and the median is the average of these two numbers.

- The quartiles should divide the two distributions either side of the median in half. Re-apply the formula for the median for each half to find the lower and upper quartiles.

---

  
_Example: Consider the set of numbers `\(\{ 7, 7, 2, 3, 4, 2, 7, 9, 31\}\)`_

- Since there are 9 numbers, the median is the (9 + 1)/2 th observation, i.e. the 5th observation, which is 7.
```html
2, 2, 3, 4, [7], 7, 7, 9, 31
```

- The median of the left distribution `\(\{2,2,3,4 \}\)` gives the lower quartile, i.e. the middle value between 2 and 3 = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```html
2, [2, 3], 4, [7], 7, 7, 9, 31
```

- The median of the right distribution `\(\{7,7,9,31 \}\)` gives the lower quartile, i.e. the middle value between 7 and 9 = (7 + 9) / 2 = 8.
```html
2, 2, 3, 4, [7], 7, [7, 9], 31
```
---

- Sometimes, the following rule is used to find the quartiles:
  $$
  Q_1 = \frac{1}{4}(n + 1)\text{th observation}
  $$
  $$
  Q_3 = \frac{3}{4}(n + 1)\text{th observation}
  $$
  This rule agrees with the above method when `\(n\)` is odd, but there is a discrepancy when `\(n\)` is even. But it does not make a great deal of difference whichever method is used.

---

To find the median and quartiles of data in the form of an ungrouped frequency distribution, it is useful to find the cumulative frequency.

_Example: The table shows the cumulative number of attempts needed to pass the driving test by 100 candidates at a particular test centre._

| No. of attempts           | `\(\leq\)` 1 | `\(\leq\)` 2 | `\(\leq\)` 3 | `\(\leq\)` 4 | `\(\leq\)` 5 | `\(\leq\)` 6 |
|---------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Cumulative freq.|    33   |    75   |    88   |    94   |    98   |   100   |

Since there are `\(n=100\)` observations,
- `\(Q_2\)` is the middle value of 50 and 51, i.e. the 50.5th observation. This lies in the class of '$\leq 2$' attempts.
- `\(Q_1\)` is the 25th observation, which lies in the class of '$\leq 1$' attempts.
- `\(Q_3\)` is the 75th observation, which lies in the class of '$\leq 2$' attempts.

# Quartiles for grouped data

---

- When data have been grouped into intervals, the original information has been lost, so it is only possible to make _estimates_ of the median and quartiles.

- One way of doing this is to use a cumulative frequency graph (polygon or curve).
  - `\(Q_1\)` is the `\(\frac{1}{4}\)`th reading.
  - `\(Q_2\)` is the `\(\frac{1}{2}\)`th reading.
  - `\(Q_3\)` is the `\(\frac{3}{4}\)`th reading.
