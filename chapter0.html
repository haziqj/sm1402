&lt;!-- # Fire Safety Briefing --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

&lt;!-- In the event of a fire, the fire alarm will operate and everyone must immediately evacuate the building. Please: --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Exit the building in a calm and orderly fashion. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Leave your belongings and non-essential items. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Do NOT use the lifts; assist anyone having difficulty. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Make your way to the Assembly Point at BIOLOGY CAR PARK (NEAR BACK ENTRACE TO MASJID) --&gt;

&lt;!-- Please listen to and obey instructions given by Fire Marshalls and Fire &amp; Rescue Personnel. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RE-ENTER THE BUILDING BEFORE GIVEN THE ALL-CLEAR THAT IT IS SAFE TO DO SO. --&gt;

  ```

- Classes are on 
   - **Saturdays, 9.50am&amp;mdash;11.40am** online

&lt;!-- - CU-0304 students will only attend the first 7 weeks (Ch. 1-3 only), and then proceed to learn Basic Calculus (Dr. Norhayati Hamzah). --&gt;

- Students have attended Basic Calculus with Dr. Norhayati Hamzah in weeks 1-7. Now proceeding to learn Basic Statistics.

- Slides and materials are available from Canvas.

&lt;!-- - Bring a calculator to class! --&gt;

&lt;!-- - This course is designed for students with no background in stats. --&gt;

---

- The course is assessed as follows:

  - Formative assessment
  
      - Exercise sheets 
      
      - Tutorials
      
--

  - Summative assessment
    
      - 1 × assignment, due at the end of Semester.
      
      - Exam.

# Why Statistics?

---
class: middle

.center[.huge[
Statistics is the science of learning from data.
]]

It is the crucial process which allows us to
- make discoveries in scientific studies (_inference_)

- make _predictions_ about future observations

- make informed decisions based on data

.large[.center[Learning Statistics allows you to make _trustworthy analyses and predictions_ about the real world.]]

# Statistical concerns

---

### 1. Data summary

- A vital part of statistics is to succintly convey and report _information_.

- Being versed in the correct statistical techniques will avoid you being duped by flawed statistics.

- One example: _&lt;u&gt;The flaw of averages&lt;/u&gt;_

- While it is useful to condense a large amount of information to a singular 'statistic', often it can be misleading.

---

Numbers of men expected to die at each age (UK, mortality rate 2010-2012). Mean age = 79, Median = 82, Mode = 86.

---
class:center

![:scale 100%](figures/flaw_avg1.png)


---

### 2. What's your proof?

- Statistics provide the framework for discerning 'credible truth' by means of 'statistical significance'.

--

- _Example: Kathrina declares that by tasting her bobba drink, she is able to distinguish whether bubble tea pearls were added *before* or *after* milk tea was added to the cup._

--

- How do we know she's telling the truth? We can set up an experiment of course...

--

- Eight cups of bobba were prepared, four of which had the pearls poured in first, and the remaining four had the tea poured in first. 

- The lady tastes the bobba at random and tells us whether the tea or the pearls was poured in first for each cup.

---

### 2. What's your proof?

.center[![](figures/tea_cups.png)]

- Kathrina correctly guesses **3 out of 8**. Is she telling the truth?

--

- Kathrina correctly guesses **4 out of 8**. Is she telling the truth?

--

- Kathrina correctly guesses **5 out of 8**. Is she telling the truth?

--

- How large is large?

- We can use a hypothesis test to inform us the chance (p-value) of the lady correctly answering the taste tests, under the assumption that her claim is true.

- Low p-values indicate evidence against her claim.

---

### 3. Measures of association

- Statistics and statistical modelling concerns the measurement of correlations between variables.

- In a lot of scientific studies, we want to understand the behaviour of two or more variables taken together. For example,
  
  - Low unemployment is _associated_ with high GDP output.
  - High satisfaction in the workplace is _associated_ with low turnover (job quitting) rates.
  - Lung cancer is found to be _more prevalent_ among people who smoke.

---

### 3. Measures of association


- Caution: **CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION**

--

- "A study found that children with small feet tend to have low IQ scores"

--

- Small feet causes low IQ?

--

- No, children with small feet are younger children, and IQ develops as they grow.
  
---

.center[.large[Be wary of spurious correlations]]

![](figures/spurious.png)

---

On the other hand, causation &lt;u&gt;requires&lt;/u&gt; STRONG CORRELATION.

.center[![:scale 90%](figures/tea-map1.png)]

---

The world has only two words for tea: tea or cha. Which word you use very much depends on the region you are in (strong correlation). But there is a cause for this:

Chá (茶) is "Sinitic", common to many varieties of Chinese, eventually becoming chai (چای) in Persian.
However, the character is pronounced as 'te', derived probably from tu (荼), in Min Chinese (Fujian etc.).


---

### 4. Reliability (of data and assumptions)

- Understanding _how_ the data was collected, and what (model) _assumptions_ were made, allows us to be vigilant when wrong conclusions are drawn.

--

- _Example: Survey sampling bias._

- Data that is collected should be _representative_ of the population of interest, in order for _valid_ inferences to be drawn.

- Types of sampling errors:
  - Convenience sampling.
  - Substitutions.
  - Multiplicity.
  - Volunteering.

---

.center[![:scale 90%](figures/survey_bias.jpeg)]

---

### 5. How likely is it?

- When done correctly, statistical modelling allows us to predict future outcomes (with a degree of confidence).

- This is the main concern of **machine learning**: Learning from data and patterns.

- Statistics also allows us to learn about trends and perform forecasting (time-series analyses).

# SM-1402 Basic Statistics

---

- What will we learn in this course?

- Mainly, the foundations and basics of statistics. This includes data summary, probability, and distributions.

- There are several statistics modules being offered here in FOS and they advance progressively.
